	<h1>Our Mission</h1> 
	<h2>Extending the Healing Ministry of Christ</h2> 

	<p>Our mission, extending the healing ministry of Christ, comes from the study of scripture. Jesus spent a great deal of his ministry on this Earth healing the sick, helping those in need, and offering them a new and better life. Our hope is that through our caregivers, His healing touch will be felt by all who come to us for care.</p>

	<p> Our mission strengthens our commitment to health care. Because of our faith as part of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, we focus on healing the whole personâ€“mind, body and spirit.</p>

	<p>In fact, Seventh-day Adventists believe that spiritual and emotional health are vital elements to overall well being. It is this belief that guides us in all we do at Florida Hospital and it has helped us to create one of the finest health care facilities in the U.S., if not the world.</p>
