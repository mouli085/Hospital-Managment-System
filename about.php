	<h2>The things that make Sanitas Hospital different are making a big difference in the lives of our patients.</h2>
	<p>Sanitas Hospital is one of the country’s largest not-for-profit health care providers with 22 campuses serving communities throughout Florida. Being a not for profit hospital means we are here for something much more important: you. For more than 100 years, we have been profoundly committed to those who seek our care. We’ve become known the world over for the expert, compassionate, individualized attention given to the millions who have already passed through our doors, and the million plus patients who visit us each year.</p>
	<p>Since 1908, our commitment to providing unsurpassed health and wellness services has expanded to meet the increasing needs of our ever-growing population. As we’ve adapted with the changing times, our mission has remained a constant—to extend the healing ministry of Christ. Our heritage of whole person health—achieving wellness of the mind, body and spirit for our patients—is of paramount importance to each member of our exceptionally talented clinical staff.</p>
	<p>As we look to the future of health care, we continue to grow and evolve. We believe that a hospital should be as focused on treating injury and illness as it is to helping people avoid the need for treatment completely. With initiatives like CREATION Health, we are cultivating community-wide movements toward adopting healthier lifestyles for greater longevity. And development of Health Village, our 172-acre mixed use planned community, will provide an immersive environment rich in resources that encourage whole-person health.</p>
	<p>Just as profound as what is happening beyond our doors is what can be found within. World class services in cancer, orthopaedics, gynecology, cardiac, rehab, pediatric medicine and more; brilliant clinicians and researchers; treatments and technologies found nowhere else in the region; and a one-of-a-kind surgical training facility preparing the next generation of doctors.</p>
	<p>We invite you to discover more about Sanitas Hospital’s award winning services and the 22 distinct campuses within our network of care.</p>
