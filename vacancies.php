		<img src="doctors.jpg" style="margin-left: 80px;height: 200px; width: 800px; ">
		<p>SANITAS is a reasonably busy small to medium Hospital in Mikocheni in Dar es Salaam. We have on average per day 300+ patients in our Out-patient department and some 20 beds in our In-patient area (soon to be upgraded and increased). All of our General Practitioners (GP's) work according to a roster as per patient load. </p>
		<p>> Night shift is part of our GP roster, all doctors share the load of night shifts </p>
		<p>> Our GP's are expected to be Registered with the Tanzania Medical Council and to have a current and up to date Certificate of Retention </p>
		<p>> Our GP's are expected to exhibit exemplary behaviour as senior staff members, and to show compassion and interest in the ongoing health and wellbeing of our patients</p>
		<p>> Our GP's are expected to keep themselves fully versed in the latest medical and treatment developments and to take an interest and contribute to the direction of improvements and expansions of SANITAS patient services</p>

		<h2 id="Laboratory">LABORATORY TECHNICIANS</h2>
		<img src="laboratory.jpg" style="width: 900px; height: 200px; margin-left: 80px;">
		<p>SANITAS has a large medical testing laboratory, we process upwards of 500 investigations per day. It is busy, there is pressure, and only accuracy is accepted. We have a large team of technicians to carry this load for the 24 hours that we are open every day. Whilst we designate particular areas or duties as your primary work, we expect all of our technicians to be highly flexible. If you are not confident in some areas, you will be trained. As an employee at SANITAS Hospital you must be prepared to do any reasonable work requested, even if it is outside of your area or region of expertise.</p>

		<h2 id="Radiology">RADIOGRAPHERS/SONOGRAPHERS</h2>
		<img src="lab2.jpg" style="margin-left: 80px; ">
		<p>SANITAS has a very busy Medical Imaging department, including Radiology and Sonography. We have from 40-70 patient exams per day, all of whom need to be handled with extreme care and compassion, as well as technical accuracy. Our Medical Imaging team is small, all technicians are preferred to be multi-talented in both Radiology and Sonography.</p>
		<p>Technicians work autonomously and are expected to take responsibility for their patients from booking up until the issuing of the report. All imaging patients are processed through our computer system, so a high degree of computer literacy is required. The imaging department is not open 24 hours a day, however this can change at any time and all technicians applying must be aware that night shift is a possibility and being on-call afterhours and on holidays is very likely. As an employee at SANITAS Hospital you must be prepared to do any reasonable work requested, even if it is outside of your area or region of expertise.</p>

Computer literacy is an absolute necessity, all of SANITAS pharmacy transactions, orders and stock control is done through computerized systems. </p>
		<p>Whilst we designate particular areas or duties as your primary work, we expect all of our technicians to be highly flexible. If you are not confident in some areas, you will be trained. As an employee at SANITAS Hospital you must be prepared to do any reasonable work requested, even if it is outside of your area or region of expertise.</p>
